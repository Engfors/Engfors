- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Engfors
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m working as CTO at Devoteam G Cloud Sweden, with a varied background in Cloud Architecture, Infrastructure & Network engineering and leading a team in a flat organisation. 
<br> On a daily basis, I am a no-nonsense, to-the-point person focusing on solving the problem in front of me. I like the casual atmosphere and I highly value teamwork.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m planning to learn GO that pairs well with my work with IaC!
